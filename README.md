# Group 2 - NLP-243 final project -- Gender De-biasing

Instructions:

The `data` folder contains all the data used in the notebook.

The `gender_debiasing.ipynb` contains the two techniques we explored for de-biasing: data augmentation, word embedding neutralization.

To run the notebook, open it in jupyter notebook or google colab and run the play button.

The dependencies are: transformers library from huggingface, allennlp_models -- both of these libraries are installed in the very beginning of the notebook using pip.

For the data augmentation, if the un-augmented data needs to be run, please search for the variable `augmentation=True` and set it to `augmentation=False` before running the notebook.
